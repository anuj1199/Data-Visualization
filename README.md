# Data-Visualization
Visualizing data structure is one of the hardest job student and many others can face. Study examines that student found difficulties in understanding the basic data structures. As the data structure and algorithm concepts are very wide and one of the major pillars of computer science students for their bright future. Therefore it is important for instructor so that he can be able to visualize the working of how searching is happening and which sorting consumes less time. These problems can only be understandable if students can visualize it properly. That's why our application comes forward. As smartphones have become a necessity in this decade, we have developed a data structure visualization application which as of now, there isn't any application available in the market. As available visualization applications are only web supported, we are processing it for smartphone supported. The interface will be improved to make the experience of user better. The animation in our app will help the user to understand the concept of the data-structure. Since itâ€™s an android application, the user will easily access it anywhere and at any time. It provides an interactive way of learning concepts.
